Revision history for Mojolicious-Plugin-OAuth2-Server

0.20     2015-06-24
        - auth codes, access tokens, and refresh tokens returned can now be
          JWTs (implemented via Mojo::JWT). this allows validation without
          database lookup *should you want to do that*. see the examples,
          tests, and perldoc. to get JWTs set the jwt_secret in the plugin
          config

0.11     2015-03-19
        - update examples/oauth2_client.pl to work with latest version of
          Mojolicious::Plugin::OAuth2. point to examples/ in the perldoc
        - tweaks to perldoc to highlight that this is an implementation of
          the "Authorization Code Grant" flow

0.10     2015-03-17
        - change token_type to be Bearer rather than bearer as this maps better
          for use in the Authorization header

0.09     2015-03-16
        - fix refresh_token check to prevent it being used as an access token.
          this adds an extra argument ($is_refresh_token) to the method that
          is called to _verify_access_token

0.08     2015-02-12
        - stipulate CryptX in the Makefile.PL rather than Crypt::PRNG, as the
          latter doesn't have a VERSION number so causes dependency check to
          fail (thanks to reneeb for the report/fix)
        - some tweaks in examples

0.07     2015-02-11
        - call verify_client before redirecting to login / confirm scopes
          as there's no point logging a user in, etc, if the client is bad
        - make _verify_access_token return a list as _verify_auth_code so
          we can report the failure reason in a meaningful way.
        - add example schema and code for using the module with a relational
          database
        - harden token generation function using Crypt::PRNG random_string

0.06     2015-02-10
        - test and documentation for flash + redirect in a full fat app

0.05     2015-02-07
        - use warnings and fix any raised by tests

0.04     2015-02-06
        - refatoring and consistency tweaks

0.03     2015-02-06
        - fix regexp in tests to be looser

0.02     2015-02-06
        - POD tweaks
        - set minimum perl version (5.10.1)

0.01     2015-02-06
        - First release inspired by frustration, confusion, and hate when trying
          to implement OAuth2 resource/auth server using existing CPAN modules
